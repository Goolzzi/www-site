# The 3 Mistakes You’re Making In Lead Generation According to the Experts

In the B2B industry, conversions are used on a daily basis to define campaign goals and to ultimately lead to improved marketing ROI and sales, whether that comes from new customers, improved existing customer retention, or helping to move customers up the value chain with other products and services.

The Cup of Data team is constantly innovating to improve our services and provide the best solutions to aid in lead generation for our client’s conversion goals. Recently, we decided to turn our passion into a one-day forum bringing together marketers, sales professionals and data scientist with successful, high-level experts to hold sessions at [Conversion Data Pop](<Conversion Data Pop>) Up in Atlanta, May 22nd.

In preparation for that, we asked the experts what the biggest mistake is that marketing and sales professionals are making in 2018 and we found three common threads in their advice. so we’ve summed it up for you here in the hopes that you can avoid these pitfalls.

# Not Zoning In On Your Potential Leads

**ZONTEE HOU, Founder of Media Volery**

> There's more information out there than ever before. That means that your audience is more savvy and educated than in the past—but it also means that you're fighting for their attention now more than ever. We have to understand how people engage with technology and information in new and unique ways and be thoughtful about how we can get our message in front of them in the right places at the right times.

**KEITH FLETCHER, President of FLETCH**

> Not having identified a crystal-clear understanding of their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).

**JOHN DONLON, Senior Research Director of SiriusDecisions**

> The biggest mistake is thinking of lead generation as a volume play. "Conversion rates are lousy anyway, so why not just blast as many prospects as possible and churn through as many as we can, as fast as we can?!" The popularity of ABM highlights the value of focus, and there's, even more, to be explored beyond that; the advent of the Demand Unit allows organizations to consider not just the highest propensity accounts, but the buying groups within those accounts that have the greatest need for your services. The focus is key, and that focus is driven by great data.

**LINDSEY NELSON, Senior Sales Productivity Consultant**

> They think everyone is a potential customer instead of doing the TAM, SAM, SOM, TAM= Total Addressable Market (which is the whole market, the potential market), SAM= Serviceable Addressable Market (the reachable market), SOM= Share of Market (your Sales divided by your Serviceable Addressable Market). When companies don't plan who to target, they will target everyone and that results in expensive wasted energy with little return. Not to mention diminished belief in solutions capabilities. Salespeople are conditioned to chase money where they can find it, it has to be the right profitable fit for the customer and organization.  Guardrails are real and welcomed in the science of sales to keep the artists in their lanes.

**EUGEN GASSMAN, VP Sales and Marketing of PantaConsult**

> Casting the net too wide, intrude and interrupt people unnecessarily. Happens again and again. If your lead rate is 1% your target should not be to increase and widen the funnel but to increase your lead rate to 2 %. Not to take the role and process of sales into account…. Big mistake.

## The No.1 mistake when it comes to lead generation and marketing strategies? Substitute quality with quantity.

**Example**: When you offer a product that relates to ‘moving’ and check the statistics you can find a number between 10 to 25% of people moving in any given year in the US. And because of the huge population, this translates into big numbers of incidents- or ‘sales opportunities’ each year.

> _**Total Addressable Market (TAM) = Total Population x 18%**_

Let’s grab some simple numbers just to illustrate what is happening: Let’s assume 10% of people that move would want your product/ service and you have a historical hit rate of around 1/3. And let’s assume that 10% of the people on your total list of inhabitants will actually move in that year it boils down like this: out of 1000 people (TAM) only 100 people move (suspects) of which 10 would actually want your product (prospects) and about 3 would finally buy it (customers).

> **_Sales = TAM x 10% x 10% x 33%_**
>
> **_For example, if the TAM is 1000, then there should be about 3 conversions to sales._**

Now marketers get very happy because they can just get busy and do ‘stuff’. They believe this simple correlation is causation and because it is quantifiable you can just use it as a substitute for the real world.

Hence marketers ask: 

> _**How many customers does the business need? **_

If the answer is e.g. 300 you already see where this is going, they will target and penetrate 100,000 innocent people with finely crafted messaging, pictures, videos and whatnot and basically annoy 99,000 people for which the product has no relevance at all (90% not moving / only 10% of 10% actually need the product).

Typically marketing is happy because they are busy with their world. They don’t want to target just the 1,000 people that this offer is only remotely relevant to because printing is much cheaper and more efficient for 100,000.  For a larger population, you can make TV ads and radio ads and roadside banners and all the things marketing people love to do because they think it is their job and purpose. A whole industry lives off this.

**But it is not only a terrible waste of resources, it also spoils the target group, wears them down, and makes the numb - because of the constant penetration with irrelevant messages.** It makes a truly targeted and very specific and highly relevant offer to get unnoticed in the flood of all the noise.

**My take? Marketing is a Science!**

> Marketing departments are full of people who ‘make stuff’: pictures, slogans, brochures, ‘content’ …. But that is not marketing. Marketing is about how can I get the attention of the people that are really interested and how can I build a preference for my product/ service so sales can provide a quality buying experience for the few that truly want to buy from you.

Copy is important, but job descriptions for marketers should focus on how to use the science to drive sales with solid ROI:

> Can you truly understand situation and motives of our target customers and use this insight to influence perception and behavior.

ERICA PEARSON, Marketing and Sales Data Analyst of MessageGears

> I would say the number one mistake is buying lists. As someone who has done sales in the past, this wastes more time than it saves. The best thing to do is choose targeted accounts and put in the research to find the best personas to reach out to. If you truly understand your ideal customer profile, it makes more sense to create a targeted list of companies rather than a random list of people. Even in the start-up space, it might be a challenge to get started but I have seen the results pay off.

# Not Defining Your Strategy

**ZONTEE HOU, Founder of Media Volery**

> I see a lot of business-people chase after the latest buzzword or the newest platform, but I always ask them to slow down and ask themselves, "To what end?" While there are some use cases for a financial institution to be on Snapchat or a sports brand to be on LinkedIn, you have to make sure there is a clear fit between the execution and your business goals. Make sure you're grounded in the objectives of your business and the needs of your customers.

**REBECCA CROUCHER, VP Sales, Marketing and Data Science Solutions of Bombora**

>  For lead generation, the biggest issue I see is that companies don’t have a strategy to consistently feed the funnel daily.  They try something then stop, or do something for a month and then end it.  A great lead generation strategy is to have multiple segments and tests going on at all times with consistency so that you constantly have fresh leads coming thru the funnel.  From a strategy perspective, the issue tends to be that most companies don’t really have a defined strategy or a roadmap of how they are going to drive revenue.  They often have a lack of measurement.  There is so much opportunity for companies to drive revenue thru marketing but most have not figured it out.

**LINDSEY NELSON, Senior Sales Productivity Consultant**

> Weeding through the noise....there is an abundance of information at any "buyers" fingertips at the click of a button, a simple google search or push marketing campaigns, that doesn't mean the buyer is educated, they are just over informed.  The sales and marketing teams have to identify their ideal customer profile, the key decision makers and the relevant role and industry challenges facing the companies they are targeting today.  They need to rise through the noise with relevant messaging that speaks to that buyer in their current buyer's journey to earn the right to connect.  Once that happens people still and will always buy from people they believe and trust.  Technology and Data can help cut through the noise quickly when it's the first thought on strategic targeting, not an afterthought.

**EUGEN GASSMAN, VP Sales and Marketing of PantaConsult**

> Funnel optimism: today most often in the form of (grossly) underestimating the decision-making process at the customer-level.

# Not Enough Data Collection

**KEVIN MATSUSHITA, Director Global Alliances and Account Management of Inside View Technologies, Inc.**

> Alignment between sales and marketing teams.  This is not new, but more specifically, what is a growing challenge is having the best target market data.  Having sufficient and accurate data on target accounts and prospects is challenging.  Aligning the data between sales and marketing teams is an even bigger challenge.  In surveying sales and marketing leaders, InsideView has found that these leaders are recognizing this as a growing problem.  In just the last two years, this challenge has rocketed from the bottom half of the survey to the top in terms of what these leaders view as blockers to success.  The reason this topic should be top of minds is better alignment leads to some remarkable results - 38% higher sales win rates, 36% higher customer retention, 10% more reps hitting quota.   Also, companies that exceed their revenue goals are 2.3x more likely to report high levels of alignment.

**JOSH FRANK, Founder & Head of Optimization of Test Triggers**

> Unfounded assumptions. When I am working with organizations I hear things like this all the time: "95% of our prospects want X." WHAT?! 95% of people don't agree on anything. Only 57% of people prefer warm weather over cold, and you're supposed to have me believe that 95% of your prospects fall into one opinion? Any time that I hear this in an organization I immediately stop the conversation to investigate. Use actual customer research (it's easier than you think) to support your arguments or else you're simply guessing.

**ERICA PEARSON, Marketing and Sales Data Analyst of MessageGears**

> The biggest challenge for me is having access to a massive amount of data and information, and making sure we use it intelligently and efficiently.

**LINDSEY NELSON, Senior Sales Productivity Consultant**

> Be intentional, look at the data, apply your "wins" to what looks like your Wins and scale your success for faster larger wins, and learn where and how to pivot.  Too many companies do a Win/Loss analysis too late when the losses immediately surface "bad fit" which could have been avoided in effort from the beginning.

While the marketing and sales fields are constantly evolving, it’s best to make sure that you better focus your lead funnels, come up with and commit to a sales strategy and that you collect and use your customer data to complement the other two. 

Our speakers have more to say on this topic and more but you’ll only be able to see them all together at their sessions during [Conversion Data Pop Up](https://conversiondatapopup.cupofdata.com) in Atlanta, May 22nd.

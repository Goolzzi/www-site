# Leads at B2B SaaS Companies: Challenges and Opportunities

## Abstract

* Account Based Marketing (ABM) initiatives require prospecting to find high quality leads.
* SaaS B2B leads are expensive and even more so when considering the amount of time spent prospecting for new leads.
* As more data is collected, the prospecting process should get smarter over time, but that usually is not the case.

## The Definition of a Lead

First things first. Every SaaS B2B company needs leads to maintain or increase revenue. Even if a SaaS B2B company took the strategic decision of not growing their revenue (unlikely, but let’s just assume that is the case), the company would still have to spend money to get new leads to cover for churn.

So, what is a lead? A lead is a very broad term used to describe a contact that has a propensity to purchase a product or service. A lead, as the name implies, leads to sales. There are several definitions we should consider when in the land of leads:

* **Prospecting**: this is the activity related to finding leads. Without prospecting, there are no leads and without leads there are no sales.
* **Cost per Lead (CPL)**: this is the cost to obtain a new ‘qualified’ lead.
* **Information Qualified Lead (IQL)**: IQL’s are those leads that have engaged with one of your campaigns or your content and have shared basic but important information, particularly an email address.
* **Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)**: marketing qualified leads are when marketing teams identify leads that have interacted with your content or service. MQL’s are also known as “warm” leads.
* **Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)**: sales qualified leads are those that have been reviewed by a sales development representative and that have a strong propensity to purchase a product or service. Engagement speed is key here!

## The Time and Cost of Obtaining Leads

It goes without saying that businesses have to spend money to get leads. Businesses spend within a wide range to get these leads. Many factors are in play, but at the end of the day companies want to maximize their return on obtaining-a-sql investment. Plus, by some estimates marketers and sales reps spend up to 40% of their time prospecting!

Good sales reps are very persistent and are colloquially known as “hunters”. They understand that it takes an average of eight call attempts to reach a prospect. In addition to being persistent, they have built relationships that help them quickly tap into new opportunities. But the fact remains that most businesses spend an inordinate amount of time searching for accurate account and contact information to engage with potential customers.

According to the [Demand Generation Benchmark Report](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/file-2325837932-pdf/Corporate_Content/Demand-Gen-Benchmarks-Report-Final.pdf) from from HubSpot circa 2015, companies in the information tech & services industry obtain between 500 and 1,000 leads per month and spend between $51 and $100 per lead. It can be determined that in 2015, companies in the IT & services industry spent between $25,500 and $100,000 every month for leads:

* \[500 leads minimum] * \[$51/lead minimum] = $25,500 minimum for leads
* \[1,000 leads maximum] * \[$100/lead maximum] = $100,000 maximum for leads

In 2017, [this same report](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/2017%20Demand%20Generation%20Benchmark%20Report.pdf) was published again with more recent data stating that, on average, IT & services companies were spending approximately $369.88 per lead, a major increase from 2015. On average, approximately 3,052 of the leads that they received were SQLs, and around 416 sales opportunities were generated from these leads. Specifically focusing on the SQLs that lead to sales, it can be calculated that IT & service companies spent around $153,870 per month:

* \[416 sales from SQLs] * \[$369.88 per lead] = $153,870.08 per month for successful sales from SQLs

Based on the information provided between 2015 and 2017, it can be concluded that the amount that companies are spending per lead is increasing over time. In 2015, IT & services companies spent anywhere between $25,500 and $100,000 every month for leads, and in 2017, these same business spent around $153,870.88 per month on successful SQLs.

And this isn’t even considering opportunity costs!

A search on Google for “how much time do sales reps spend prospecting” returns quite a bit of data which states that prospecting takes anywhere from *20% to 40% for the sales representatives time*. In many cases the prospecting work is simply attempting to validate an email address or phone number, before any engagement can take place. Considering sales representatives are in large part the lifeblood for the business, reducing the time spent prospecting could help significantly boost business’s revenue.

Imagine for example that 20% of a sales rep’s time was refocused on selling instead of prospecting. That would help them and the business increase their top line in a big way. Other benefits arise, such as increased lead velocity and improved cash flow.

## Prospecting in the Land of ABM

B2B companies are turning to Account Based Marketing because even with the expense of prospecting, its still in many cases cheaper than paying for search or social media campaigns to capture user data. Account Based Marketing initiatives rely primarily identifying specific markets to target and relying on using trusted data sources to find relevant information.

However, assuming marketing and sales has coordinated their efforts and successfully launched an ABM strategy, then marketers and sales reps need to do some serious prospecting to a good match and then engage that prospect to attempt to convert it into a lead. The prospecting deliverable is to get:

- High quality lead
- Accurate contact information, particularly telephone numbers and emails
- Context that will help sales deliver the right message, at the right time, in the right format

Although this is a more targeted approach, it is a more manual process. Sometimes the numbers do not reflect the opportunity costs of having reps spend up to 40% of their time prospecting. Furthermore, if the organization does not have dedicated Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) available, one sales rep would have to do both the prospecting and close the sale, which is a process that is not scalable.

## Conclusion

Let’s face it, selling to businesses is hard. Sales reps have to deal with the fact that a purchase decision is done by a committee and not by an individual. That means sales representatives have to call and convince multiple personas within an organization before a purchase is made. Granted, in this day and age the prospect has probably done most of their research before even engaging with the vendor, but some engagement with multiple people is necessary, especially at higher price points.

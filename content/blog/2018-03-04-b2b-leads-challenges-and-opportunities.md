Businesses spend a lot of money and time prospecting. SaaS B2B companies, in particular, need to consider many attributes when identifying leads that have the right 'fit' and 'behavior' information. This article helps define different types of leads for SaaS B2B companies, where accurate data resides, and how these leads should consider both fit and behavior information to measure an accurate lead score, also known as an account propensity score (APS).

# The Definition of a Lead

First things first. Every SaaS B2B company needs leads to maintain or increase revenue. Even if a SaaS B2B company took the strategic decision of not growing their revenue (unlikely, but let’s just assume that is the case), the company would still have to spend money to get new leads to cover for churn.

So, what is a lead? A lead is a very broad term used to describe a contact that has a propensity to purchase a product or service. A lead, as the name implies, leads to sales. There are several definitions we should consider when in the land of leads:

* **Cost per Lead (CPL)**: this is the cost to obtain a new ‘qualified’ lead.
* **Information Qualified Lead (IQL)**: IQL’s are those leads that have engaged with one of your campaigns or your content and have shared basic but important information, particularly an email address.
* **Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)**: marketing qualified leads are when marketing teams identify leads that have interacted with your content or service. MQL’s are also known as “warm” leads.
* **Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)**: sales qualified leads are those that have been reviewed by a sales development representative and that have a strong propensity to purchase a product or service. Engagement speed is key here!

# Leads in the World of B2B

In the B2B world, leads are associated to accounts. Leads and their associated accounts have propensity scores, also known as Account Propensity Scores (APS’s). The APS helps determine the likelihood of conversion, which helps organizations set priorities. So, in SaaS B2B companies one must treat a lead as the combination of an account and its contacts.

This is due to the fact that in the B2B world decisions are made in many cases by committees, not just one person within the account. It’s safe to assume that B2B leads are more expensive to obtain and convert, simply for the reason that vendors must acquire, nurture, and engage multiple contacts for one sale.

Generally speaking, B2B companies structure a mix of inbound marketing and account based marketing (ABM) campaigns, such as with content marketing or search, to identify IQLs, MQLs, and SQLs. Selecting which accounts and contacts to target before hand is known as Account Based Marketing (ABM). This allows companies to structure targeted campaigns at specific accounts and contacts within those accounts, which in theory improves conversion rates.

# Leads with Account Propensity Scores (APS)

Why should marketers assign a lead score (APS) before assigning a lead to the sales organization? Put simply, it allows companies to rank leads by priority. If there are only two sales reps available and ten leads in the funnel, then these leads to a ranking so sales reps don’t spend time on low value leads and focus most of their efforts on higher value leads.

APS’s, generally speaking, are calculated by mixing ‘fit’ and ‘behavior’ data. Fit data is information that allows marketers and sales reps understand if an account and their contacts meets their criteria for an ideal account. Behavior data is used to measure intent and usually requires more of a learning process. The weight assigned to each attribute in the fit and behavior categories is also known as ‘attribution’. Estimating attribution for each campaign can be very complex, but generally speaking businesses:

* **Fit information**. Fit information is a combination of firmographic, technographic, and demographic data. Questions such as ‘what companies are located in the midwest, which sell more that 10 million but less that 50 million and have Salesforce’
* **Behavior information**. Measuring intent is important as usually the first company to engage a potential customer has a much higher likelihood of closing the deal. Behavior should be measured on inbound marketing channel content as well as public channels.
* **Attribution**. The attributes and their weights are usually tested and adjusted over time, depending on what combination of attributes (and their weights) lead to improved conversion rates. Examples include ‘score zero on IP’s that come from our office’ and ‘score two on users that download xyz ebook.’

It’s important to consider both fit and behavior data when assigning attribution to calculate accurate APS’s. Furthermore, the solution space needs constant testing to

# The Time and Cost of Obtaining Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)

It goes without saying that businesses have to spend money to get SQLs. Businesses spend within a wide range to get these leads. Many factors are in play, but at the end of the day companies want to maximize their return on obtaining-a-sql investment. Plus, by some estimates marketers and sales reps spend up to 40% of their time prospecting! Good sales reps are known colloquially as “hunters” and have built relationships that help them quickly tap into new opportunities. But the fact remains that most businesses spend an inordinate amount of time finding accurate account and contact information to engage with potential customers.

According to the Demand Generation Benchmark Report from from HubSpot circa 2015, companies in the information tech & services industry obtain between 500 and 1,000 leads per month and spend between $51 and $100 per lead. It can be determined that in 2015, companies in the IT & services industry spent between $25,500 and $100,000 every month for leads:

* \[500 leads minimum] * \[$51/lead minimum] = $25,500 minimum for leads
* \[1,000 leads maximum] * \[$100/lead maximum] = $100,000 maximum for leads

In 2017, this same report was published again with more recent data stating that, on average, IT & services companies were spending approximately $369.88 per lead, a major increase from 2015. On average, approximately 3,052 of the leads that they received were SQLs, and around 416 sales opportunities were generated from these leads. Specifically focusing on the SQLs that lead to sales, it can be calculated that IT & service companies spent around $153,870 per month:

* \[416 sales from SQLs] * \[$369.88 per lead] = $153,870.08 per month for successful sales from SQLs

Based on the information provided between 2015 and 2017, it can be concluded that the amount that companies are spending per lead is increasing over time. In 2015, IT & services companies spent anywhere between $25,500 and $100,000 every month for leads, and in 2017, these same business spent around $153,870.88 per month on successful SQLs.

## Opportunity Costs

A search on Google for “how much time do sales reps spend prospecting” returns quite a bit of data which states that prospecting takes anywhere from 20% to 40% for the sales representatives time. In many cases the prospecting work is simply attempting to validate an email address or phone number, before any engagement can take place. Considering sales representatives are in large part the lifeblood for the business, reducing the time spent prospecting could help significantly boost business’s revenue.

Imagine for example that 20% of a sales rep’s time was refocused on selling instead of prospecting. That would help them and the business increase their top line in a big way. Other benefits arise, such as increased lead velocity and improved cash flow.

## Google AdWords for B2B SaaS Companies

In a report released based on data from 2017, Software and SaaS B2B companies spent approximately $106 per lead through Google AdWords. Around 32% of all company leads for the year were produced from Google AdWords for B2B SaaS companies included in this study, and around 38% of the leads led to sales opportunities, with an average rate of interest of 255%. The revenue produced from each sale due to Google AdWords for B2B SaaS companies in 2017 was approximately $340. Although Google AdWords is not providing a list of SQLs to businesses, it provides a way to understand average spending habits of B2B SaaS companies and how it produces leads.

## LinkedIn Ads for B2B SaaS Companies

A 2016 report regarding the use of LinkedIn ads by Software and SaaS B2B companies stated that around $575 in revenue is generated per lead through LinkedIn ads, and approximately $3,500 in revenue for sales due to these ads. Although no numbers were provided based on how much these companies spend per lead through these, the report did state that B2B SaaS and software companies spent around 2.5% of their total revenue on LinkedIn ads, and around 5% of their total leads come from these ads.

## Sources for Accurate Fit and Behavior Data

There are several vendors that aggregate information about businesses and sell access to this data with tiered pricing models. Some vendors are more specialized with company compliance data, such as SEC filings and credit risk, while others are more focused on obtaining and updating information about what technology stacks companies use to run their business. This is very valuable information for SaaS B2B companies since they can implement Account Based Marketing strategies and target specific technology stacks along with other firmographic and technographic data.
# The Need to Improve Lead Quality and Velocity Over Time
Have you ever hired a firm to help you with prospecting and after spending hours with them one of the key members from their team moves on to another gig? We have. It’s not like you have to start all over again with the training, but it’s still very time consuming to retrain people. In an ideal world, a prospecting service would get smarter the more you use it. Not only should the leads get better (read higher APS) but these leads should be delivered faster. Practice _should_ make perfect.

# Conclusion

Let’s face it, selling to businesses is hard. Sales reps have to deal with the fact that a purchase decision is made by a committee and not by an individual. That means sales representatives have to call and convince multiple personas within an organization before a purchase is made. Granted, in this day and age the prospect is has probably done most of their research before even engaging with the vendor, but some engagement with multiple people is necessary, especially at higher price points.

Leading organizations have automated the B2B sales process as much as possible to improve the productivity of their sales organization. This has far reaching implications for the business, as it allows it to compress sales cycles, improve conversions (we all know that calling first is half the battle), and increase deal size. Plus, but considering both fit and behavior data in a propensity score has the added benefit of helping companies engage potential customers with the right message, at the right time, and in the right format. Continually improving this process over time helps organizations remain competitive.
